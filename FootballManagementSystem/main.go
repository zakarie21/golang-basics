Questions:
1. Create a Player struct with Name, Position, and Goals
2. Make a slice of Player called team
3. Write AddPlayer function to add new players to the team
4. Write UpdateGoals function to increase a playerâ€™s goals or return an error if not found
5. Use a map called teamStats to track total goals and players, and write ShowStats to print it
